# SUBATOMIC:	SUbgraph BAsed mulTi-OMIcs Clustering
The subgraph based multi-omics clustering (SUBATOMIC) pipeline is a module inference
and annotation framework to integrate and cluster networks into functional modules.
Interaction networks can be of any interaction type and contain directed or directed
edges such as TF-target networks, miRNA-target networks or protein-protein interaction
networks as long as they have a common set of shared nodes. 
SUBATOMIC  first integrates all networks into one prior network and decomposes it into 
two- and three-node subgraphs using ISMAGS. The resulting subgraphs are further 
categorized according to their type (ALL, COM, COR, COP, CIR, FBU, FB2U) and
clustered into modules using the hyper edge clustering algorithm SCHype. The resulting
modules contain a high density of subgraphs and are further characterized with 
the functional enrichment method GOATOOLS. Relation with regulators and other
modules were derived in a superview step summarizing interaction shared between modules and 
regulators pointing at them.

## How to run SUBATOMIC: Toy example
Calculating modules for the integrated network published in the paper takes a lot
of compute power and space. We therefore sampled down the inital network to create 
a smaller toy example for *H. sapiens* that can be used as a test example. 

### Dependencies
Make sure all dependencies are installed and ready to use. The version number of
python packages should be seen as recommendation, since the pipeline might also 
work with slightly different versions.  

- Python >3.6  
  - numpy 1.20.2  
   - pandas 1.2.4  
   - itertools   
   - subprocess  
   - re  
   - shutil  
   - GOATOOLS 1.0.15  
- Snakemake 6.1.2   
- R > 4.0.0  
   - igraph   

### Installation and start
Clone the repository and adapt the config file.  
The pipeline can be started calling:  
```snakemake -s Integrated_Pipeline --configfile config_test_hsapiens_toyNet.yaml --cores 3```

### Required and optional input files
Shows an overview of the files required for the analysis. Except for go-basic.obo, all file names can be freely chosen but have to be set in the config file. In this list, all files are contained in the example folder. 

1. ```go-basic.obo```  

- Required for functional enrichment with GOATOOLS  
- Located in the base folder next to 'Integrated_Pipeline'
- Latest version can be obtained from [GENEONTOLOGY](http://geneontology.org/docs/download-ontology/)
2. ```Hsapiens_goa_ensembl.gaf```  

- Required for functional enrichment with GOATOOLS  
- Latest version can be obtained from [GENEONTOLOGY_annotations](http://geneontology.org/docs/download-go-annotations/)
- Need to match the identifiers of the input network. For the toy example, we already mapped to the correct namespace.

3. ```Hsapens_subgraphs.csv```  

- Plane list of all subgraphs without header
- Due to symmetric reasons, some subgraphs can be redundant. From a set of equivalent subgraphs, only one should be kept
- List can be self defined or generated using the utility script generate_motif_list.py that gives a non-redundant list of motifs given the network letters

4. ```Hsapiens_goa_ensembl.gaf```  

- File containing all edges from the integrated prior network
- No header, content:
  - First column contains node_1 (in case of directed interactions the regulators)
  - Second column contains node_2 (in case of directed interactions the targets)
  - Third column contains the letter representing the network to which this interaction belongs
- Networks can only contain **either** directed **or** undirected edges, but no mix of both

5. ```Hsapiens_background_genes_ensembl.csv```

- Optional, no header, plane list of identifier used as background for functional enrichment analysis
- In this example, a large number of protein coding genes in *H. sapiens*

6. ```Hsapiens_functional_description.csv```

- File containing a mapping of identifier to gene name as well as a optional short description of the gene function
- Header, content:
  - First column: Primary identifier, which are also used in the interaction file
  - Second column: External gene name
  - Third column: Potential alternative identifier or gene name
  - Fourth column: functional description

7. ```Hsapiens_miRNAs.csv```

- Plane file containing the identifier of all miRNAs
- Will be used in the superview

8. ```Hsapiens_TFs.csv```

- Plane file containing the identifier of all regulators
- Will be used in the superview

### Configuration file
 
Check the config file ```config_test_hsapiens_toyNet.yaml```.  
For the toy example, settings are already done.  

- Set all path variables:  
  - **interaction**: *string*,  path + filename to interaction file
  - **subgraph_type**: *string*, path + filename to file containing all subgraphs to be investigated
  - **Functional_Description**: *string*: path + filename to functional description file
  - **Transcription_Factors**: *string*,  path + filename to list of TF
  - **GO_ASSOCIATIONS**: *string*, path + filename to GO annotation file
  - **scripts**: *string*, path to script folder
  - **output_folder_name**: *string*, any name for an analysis run
  - **directed_interactions**, *list*, letters indicating networks containing exclusively  directed_interactions
  - **undirected_interactions**, *list*, letters indicating networks containing exclusively  undirected_interactions
  - **miRNA_interactions**: *list*, letters indicating the network containing miRNA-target interactions
  - **homolog_interactions**: *list*, letters indicating networks containing undirected homologous interactions  
  - **modules**: *list*, choice from "ALL", "COR", "COP", "CIR", "FBU", "FB2U" and "FFL". Specifies the modules included in the analysis
  - **schype_edge_weigt**: *int*, weight parameter for SCHYPE. Higher values than 1 give more emphasis to the edges in the node-to-edge ratio
  - **goatools_pvalue**: *float*, threshold p-value for gene enrichment analysis
  -  **call_R**: *string*, command how to call R from the command line. In the easiest case, R
  -  **cores**: *int*, number of cores used for the parallelization of superview. Careful: cores have to be submitted again calling snakemake with --cores. The number of cores specified here needs to be <= the number of --cores.
  - **annotation_background**: *string*, choice what should be taken as background for the functional enrichment analysis. Three options are available:
      - Path + name to a list with gene identifier that will serve as background
      - "ModuleType": All genes of a module type, e.g. all genes contained in a CIR module for CIR
      - "ALL": All genes in the input network
  - **superview_background**: *string*, choice what should be taken as background distribution for the suberview z-score calculation
    - "network": all interactions of a network type
    - "module": all interactions of a network type as well as the module e.g. CIR_H
    
### Running an example analysis for the toy net
Even though the prior network published in the paper is far from complete, calculation takes a significant amount of time.
For testing purposes we created a smaller network (toy_Net). We selected up to k modules from the SUBATOMIC run  based on the full network and 
re-created an interaction file containing only genes involved in this modules (for k=5). This toy net can then be used to 
test the pipeline using only a  small amount of time. However, we also provide the ```Hsapiens_interaction_file.csv``` containing the network used in the publication. **Important:** The implementation of GOATOOLS is very greedy for space, thus when annotating even a few modules with 3 cores as done in this exaple,  the RAM demand can go > 32 GB. 
1. Clone the repository 
2. Go to the base folder and unzip the go-basic.obo file with  
```tar -xzf go-basic.obo.tar.gz``` 
3. Go to example_data/Hsapiens_M1/ and unzip the GAF file with
```tar -xzf Hsapiens_goa_ensembl.gaf.tar.gz```
4. Adapt the config file. For this example, all parameters are set and the example is run on 3 cores
5. Go to the SUBATOMIC folder and run
```snakemake -s Integrated_Pipeline --configfile config_test_hsapiens_miniNet.yaml --cores 3```
In case you want to rerun the entire pipeline, you need to delete the ```Logs``` 
file in the run folder as well as the hidden .snakemake folder 
6. Investigate the results

 - All output results can be found in the folder specified in the config file
 - A list and short description of the most important output files can be found
 in the following section 

7. Visualize them with Cytoscpae

- Start Cytoscape
- Open the folder ```/data/human_network/final_networks/Hsapiens/MotifClusters/SCHYPE/SCHype*/```
- The network is contained in the ```edges.nnf file```. Open this file  in Cytoscape (e.g. drag and drop it to the network file area)
- The annotation for this network is included in ```NodeAttributes.noa```.  Open this file  in Cytoscape (e.g. drag and drop it to the table files section)
- The Cytoscape style is included in the folder ```Cytoscape``` and called ```cytoscape_style.xml```. Import the style sheet by opening the ```File``` tab, ```Import``` and ```Styles from File```. This has to be done only once for each combination of directed and un-directed network letters.
- Select all networks, right-click on ```Apply Style``` and select the imported style.  Under the tab Style and Labels, it is possible to change the IDs to gene names. 
- Hint: Cytoscape sometimes introduce an error while importing by renaming all listed modules two indices higher (e.g. COR_2 instead of COR_0). In the node table view however, the correct naming is shown. Moreover it is  recommended to only load smaller selections of modules at a time to not overload Cytoscape.

8. Contextualization

- It is possible to contextualize the data with the hypoxia dataset generated 
- For visualization of module expression, open the R script ```VisualizeHypoxia.R```
in the ```utility_scripts``` folder and adapt the working directory in line 11 to the location of the SUBATOMIC repository
- The path to input and output files should be set already for running the hypoxia data visualization as described in the paper
- Visualizations are saved at the location ```Hsapiens/contextualization_hypoxia/```
- Next, one can use the ```calculate_contextualization_scores.py``` script to calculate nPCC, ECD and activity scores
- The calculation of ECD scores for hypoxia does not give satisfying results (to less samples) but is included exemplarily in the call 
- To calculate values for this example, go to the SUBATOMIC folder and call: 
```python utility_scripts/calculate_contextualization_scores.py -expression example_data/hypoxia/GSE53012_expression.tsv -out Hsapiens/contextualization_scores/ -activity -ECD -nPCC -clusters Hsapiens/SCHYPE/ -sampling_k 20 -pvalues example_data/hypoxia/hypoxia_p-values_PC_3_mapped.csv -meta example_data/hypoxia/hypoxia_ECD_meta.csv```
